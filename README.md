# jsquiz

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

`{jsquiz}` generates quizzes in a form of multiple-choice questions. The
business logic is implemented using JavaScript, therefore, no back-end
required (e.g., Shiny). This package was developed to allow for
exercises in `{bookdown}` books. Currently, works only with `{bookdown}`
projects, but with a slight modification, one can include those
exercises into regular R Markdown and Quatro documents.

## Installation

You can install the development version of jsquiz from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("irudnyts/jsquiz")
```
